# MGX-Discord-Bot
Source code for the bot that was once a part of 124 servers, serving more than 8,000 users.

Made this readme solely for the application reader of hidden-devs.

Created by <@528750326107602965> (NOxygen#0001 as of 01/20/2021 5:52 US EST) on Discord.

Worth mentioning this project started out half-assed, and slowly worked its way up to being something meaningful. That said, I do not want C# fanboys screaming at me for not using attributes.
