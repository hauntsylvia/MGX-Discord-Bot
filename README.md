# MGX-Discord-Bot
Source code for the bot that was once a part of 124 servers, serving more than 8,000 users.

Made this readme solely for the application reader of hidden-devs.

Created by <@528750326107602965> (izolabella#0216 as of 02/03/2022 1:01 PM US EST) on Discord.

Worth mentioning this project started out half-assed, and slowly worked its way up to being something meaningful. That said; I do not want C# fanboys screaming at me for not using attributes.

# Download
[redacted due to vulnerabilities]

When running the main executable file, it will generate a hosting.properties file, open that with any text editor and change the Token property to a working Discord auth token (bot account not bearer).
If you (app reader) do not wish to run this file, I can do so myself and show it working in a temporary Discord server.
